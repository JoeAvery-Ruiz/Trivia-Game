# Trivia-Game
My app is called Drinking Trivia, it is a dual player/team game where two people or groups will face-off to answer trivia questions before their opponent or the timer runs out. If a player/team loses the round or neither player/team answers correctly,  a random punishment will be assigned to them, they will have to accept their punishment of either taking a sip or chug of an “adult beverage” or even worse a shot of the winner's choice. If there is no winner then each player/team can choose the drink themselves. 
Technologies used:
Vanilla javascript,HTML and CSS

MVP goals:
To keep tack of each individual players score.

Stretch goals:
To be able to toggle through the questions with ease and even start over if need be.

Problems:
I was unable to keep track of the score between html files, as well as I wanted to iterate through an array of random punishment but was unable to do so.
